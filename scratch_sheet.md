# Animation System Migration Plan

## Initial Goal
We aimed to centralize all animations under the physics-based deceleration system and remove CSS-based animations. However, things started to break down and create errors because we had not worked through a number of pitfalls.

## Changes Made & Issues Encountered

### CSS Animation Removal
- Removed all @keyframes and CSS animation properties
- **PITFALL**: Didn't properly replace the percentile split animation functionality before removing CSS
- **LESSON**: Should have implemented JS replacements before removing CSS animations

### Animation Function Restructuring
- Added animateTransform as a central function
- **PITFALL**: Lost the complex state management of percentile mode during transition
- **LESSON**: The percentile system was more state-dependent than initially assessed

### Results Display Changes
- Modified data transformation in animateDiceRoll
- **PITFALL**: Lost track of the special structure of percentile results
- **LESSON**: Percentile results have a unique format that needs special handling

### Reset Functionality
- Updated resetD10State
- **PITFALL**: Didn't properly handle the transition between modes
- **LESSON**: State transitions are as important as the animations themselves

## Core Issues Identified

### State Management Complexity
The percentile system involves multiple states:
- Initial split animation
- Subsequent spin animations
- Opacity transitions
- Mode tracking
**LESSON**: Need to maintain all state transitions while changing animation systems

### Animation Coordination
Percentile mode requires coordinated animations:
- Split animation for first activation
- Synchronized spinning for both dice
- Proper z-indexing and opacity handling
**LESSON**: Animation system needs to handle both individual and coordinated animations

### Data Structure Dependencies
Percentile results have a specific format:
```javascript
{
  type: 'd10-tens' | 'd10-ones',
  value: number
}
```
**LESSON**: Must preserve special data structures throughout the animation pipeline

## Implementation Plan

### Stage 1: Parallel Animation System
- Keep CSS animations initially
- Add JS-based animations alongside
- Test both systems
- Only remove CSS once JS system is verified

### Stage 2: State Management
- Document all percentile states
- Ensure each state transition has a corresponding handler
- Maintain mode flags properly

### Stage 3: Animation Coordination
Create specific coordinators for:
- Standard dice
- Percentile initial split
- Percentile subsequent spins
- Use the deceleration equation consistently

### Stage 4: Data Flow
- Maintain clear data transformation pipeline
- Handle special cases explicitly
- Add type checking for different result formats

## Testing Protocol
1. Test each dice type individually
2. Test mode transitions
3. Test mixed dice pools
4. Verify all animations use deceleration
5. Confirm state cleanup on reset
6. Test interruption cases
7. Test rapid-fire rolls
8. Test state consistency

## Known Issues to Avoid
1. Compilation warning from removing animateNonStandardResult but still being imported
2. Function naming/export problems with updateResults
3. Null check issues in animateDiceIcons

## Implementation Order
1. Implement deceleration-based animations alongside CSS
2. Add state management improvements
3. Migrate standard dice animations
4. Migrate percentile split animation
5. Migrate percentile spin animation
6. Remove CSS animations only after thorough testing

## Key Insight
This is more of a state machine migration than just an animation system change. The animations are the visible part of a more complex state management system.

## Interaction Summary 1 (Current Session)

### Initial Steps Taken
1. Created `animateTransform` function in `dice-animations.js`
   - Built as a flexible foundation for all animations
   - Supports both rotation and translation with physics-based deceleration
   - Uses consistent tau value (325ms) from original implementation
   - Maintains existing animation cancellation system

2. Refactored `animateDiceIcons`
   - Removed redundant animation code
   - Now uses `animateTransform` for all standard dice
   - Maintains same timing and behavior (2000ms duration, 3 full rotations)
   - Successfully tested with standard dice rolls

3. Added `animateD10` function
   - Handles both standard d10 and percentile modes
   - Uses `animateTransform` for all animations while keeping CSS as fallback
   - Supports initial split animation and subsequent spins
   - Maintains opacity transitions for smooth mode switching

4. Updated `resetD10State`
   - Now uses `animateTransform` for position resets
   - Keeps CSS classes temporarily as fallback
   - Handles opacity transitions explicitly
   - Added proper cleanup of transforms

### Key Decisions Made
1. Chose to keep CSS animations initially as fallback
   - Prevents breaking functionality during migration
   - Allows for A/B testing of animations
   - Provides safety net for edge cases

2. Implemented parallel animation system
   - New JS animations run alongside CSS
   - Uses same timing and physics as original
   - Maintains all state transitions
   - Preserves existing functionality

3. Structured code for gradual migration
   - Each component can be tested independently
   - CSS fallback ensures continuous operation
   - State management remains unchanged
   - Animation coordination preserved

### Next Steps Planned
1. Update d10 button handler to use new `animateD10` function
2. Test animations in parallel
3. Begin gradual removal of CSS animations once verified

### Current Status
- Standard dice animations working correctly
- D10 implementation ready for testing
- CSS animations still in place as fallback
- No breaking changes introduced 

## Interaction Summary 2 (Latest Status)

### Current Issues Identified
1. D10 Standard Mode
   - No spin animation visible
   - Results display correctly
   - Number randomization animation missing
   
2. Percentile Mode (Shift-Click)
   - Split animation works but appears slower than intended
   - Possibly still using CSS animation instead of physics-based
   - Split positioning correct but timing off
   
3. Subsequent Percentile Spins
   - No spin-in-place animation after split
   - Results display correctly
   - State transitions working properly

### Root Causes Identified
1. Standard D10 Issues
   - `animateDiceIcons` may not be properly selecting the d10 element
   - Query selector for d10 button images might be incorrect
   - Number randomization animation disconnected from main animation

2. Percentile Animation Issues
   - CSS and JS animations potentially conflicting
   - Timing constants may differ between systems
   - Need to ensure `animateD10` is being called with correct parameters

3. State Management
   - Basic state transitions working
   - Animation state not properly coordinated with roll state
   - Need to verify animation cleanup between modes

### Next Steps
1. Fix Standard D10 Animation
   - Debug element selection in `animateDiceIcons`
   - Verify query selectors for d10 button
   - Reconnect number randomization

2. Standardize Percentile Animations
   - Remove CSS animations for percentile mode
   - Ensure consistent timing with physics-based system
   - Fix subsequent spin animations

3. Testing Protocol
   - Test each animation type in isolation
   - Verify timing consistency
   - Check state cleanup
   - Test rapid mode switching

### Implementation Priority
1. Fix standard d10 spin (highest priority)
2. Standardize percentile animations
3. Add number randomization back
4. Remove CSS animations
5. Final timing adjustments 

## Interaction Summary 3 (Latest Issues)

### New Issues Discovered
1. Percentile Animation Issues
   - Initial split animation shows dice fully extended ("propeller effect")
   - Subsequent spins only rotate red die on leftmost point ("nunchuck effect")
   - Blue focus box appearing around active dice

2. Number Animation Issues
   - No number animations for percentile results
   - Standard dice number animations broken
   - Error on second die roll: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'slice')

### Root Cause Analysis
1. Percentile Animation
   - Translation and rotation timing not properly coordinated
   - Transform origin not properly set for split animations
   - CSS focus styles not properly handled

2. Number Animation
   - Error in getRandomValueForDie when handling undefined dieType
   - animateResults not properly handling multiple dice rolls
   - Possible disconnect between diceTypes array and results array

### Next Steps
1. Fix Standard Dice Number Animation (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
   - Debug getRandomValueForDie function
   - Ensure proper type checking for dice parameters
   - Fix array handling in animateResults

2. Fix Percentile Animation Issues
   - Adjust transform origin for split animations
   - Coordinate translation and rotation timing
   - Remove unwanted focus styles

3. Testing Protocol
   - Test single die rolls
   - Test multiple dice combinations
   - Test percentile mode transitions
   - Verify number animations
   - Check for unwanted CSS effects

## Interaction Summary 4 (Number Animation Investigation)

### Current Status
1. Standard Dice Fixed
   - Dice spin animations working correctly
   - Results display correctly but without animation
   - Multiple dice rolls working without errors

2. Number Animation Issues
   - No number animations occurring despite code being present
   - Console output shows correct flow through animation code
   - Results appear instantly without randomization effect

### Debug Analysis from Console
1. Animation Flow
   - Button click triggers handleDieClick correctly
   - rollSpecificDie executes and generates correct values
   - animateDiceRoll called with correct parameters
   - prepareResultsData processes results correctly
   - animateResults being called with proper data

2. Key Observations
   - No errors in console related to animations
   - All data passing correctly through the system
   - Animation functions being called but not visibly executing
   - Timing values appear correct in code

### Potential Issues
1. Animation Trigger
   - requestAnimationFrame might not be properly chaining
   - Initial random value display might be overwritten
   - Animation state tracking might be failing

2. Timing Sequence
   - Number animations should start immediately
   - Should run for 1000ms using deceleration
   - Should complete before dice finish (2000ms)

### Next Steps
1. Debug Animation Function
   - Add console logs in updateNumber function
   - Verify requestAnimationFrame is executing
   - Check if progress calculations are correct
   - Ensure DOM updates are visible

2. Implementation Fixes Needed
   - Verify initial value display
   - Ensure animation loop continues
   - Check timing calculations
   - Add animation state debugging

3. Testing Protocol
   - Add console logs for animation frames
   - Monitor DOM updates
   - Verify timing sequence
   - Test multiple dice scenarios

## Interaction Summary 5 (Number Animation Investigation)

### Current Status
- Number animations are executing in JavaScript but not visible in the UI
- Console logs show correct animation sequence:
  1. Roll boxes created with proper structure
  2. Number animations running at 12fps
  3. Random values generated correctly
  4. Frame timing and progress calculations working
  5. Final values set correctly

### Debug Analysis
1. DOM Structure:
   - Roll boxes created with correct classes
   - Proper nesting: `.roll-box > .roll-value`
   - Data attributes set correctly
   - Debug outlines added but still no visible changes

2. Animation Flow:
   ```
   animateResults
   ├─ Creates roll-box div
   ├─ Creates roll-value span
   ├─ Sets visibility and display styles
   └─ Calls animateNumberResult
      ├─ Sets initial random value
      ├─ Updates at 12fps
      ├─ Shows random/final values
      └─ Completes after 1000ms
   ```

3. CSS Investigation Needed:
   - Numbers might be hidden by CSS
   - Possible z-index issues
   - Transform or opacity properties might be overridden
   - Need to check if parent containers are properly sized

### Next Steps
1. Check CSS for `.roll-box` and `.roll-value`:
   - Verify z-index stacking
   - Check for any opacity/visibility overrides
   - Verify container dimensions

2. Investigate parent containers:
   - Check `#results-rolls` dimensions and overflow
   - Verify `.results-grid` layout
   - Look for any CSS that might clip or hide content

3. Add more DOM debugging:
   - Check computed styles during animation
   - Verify element dimensions
   - Monitor for any style overrides

4. Consider CSS Isolation:
   - Move number display to overlay
   - Use absolute positioning
   - Ensure no style conflicts

### Implementation Priorities
1. Fix CSS visibility issues
2. Ensure proper element sizing
3. Verify z-index stacking
4. Test with multiple dice types

### Notes
- JavaScript animation logic is working correctly
- Issue appears to be purely CSS/visibility related
- Need to focus on styles and layout next

## Interaction Summary 5 (CSS Investigation)

### Current Status
- Number animations are executing in JavaScript (confirmed via console logs)
- 11 frames of animation running at correct intervals
- Proper timing and value calculations occurring
- But: No visual updates appearing in the UI

### CSS Changes Attempted
1. First CSS Update:
   - Added hardware acceleration hints
   ```css
   transform: translateZ(0);
   -webkit-transform: translateZ(0);
   will-change: transform;
   ```
   - Added 3D rendering context
   ```css
   transform-style: preserve-3d;
   perspective: 1000px;
   ```
   - Ensured proper stacking with z-index

2. Second CSS Update:
   - Removed forced transforms with !important
   - Added proper z-indexing for stacking context
   - Removed hardcoded transforms
   - Added will-change for both transform and opacity
   - Prevented CSS transitions from interfering
   ```css
   .results-grid .roll-value {
     opacity: 1;
     visibility: visible;
     transition: none !important;
   }
   ```

### CSS Cascade Investigation
Found complex layering of CSS rules affecting our elements:
1. Base visibility rules
2. Grid-level overrides
3. Dynamic state classes
4. Transform inheritance
5. Multiple opacity/visibility layers

### Next Steps
1. Full CSS Audit:
   - Map complete visibility inheritance chain
   - Identify all transform-affecting rules
   - Check for conflicting animation properties
   - Review all !important declarations

2. Consider Alternative Approaches:
   - Direct style manipulation instead of class toggling
   - Simplified CSS structure
   - Isolation of animation containers

### Key Insight
The JavaScript animation pipeline is working correctly (math, timing, state updates), but there appears to be a CSS cascade issue preventing the visual updates from being reflected in the UI. This suggests we need to focus on the CSS inheritance chain rather than the animation logic itself.

## Interaction Summary 6 (CSS Cleanup)

### CSS Optimization Progress
1. Results Display Section:
   - Reduced from ~200 lines to ~25 lines
   - Removed redundant properties
   - Consolidated related styles
   - Simplified selectors
   ```css
   /* Before: Multiple overlapping rules */
   .results-grid .roll-value {
     opacity: 1 !important;
     visibility: visible !important;
     transform: translateZ(0) !important;
     /* ... many more properties ... */
   }

   /* After: Clean, focused rules */
   .roll-value {
     position: absolute;
     inset: 0;
     display: flex;
     align-items: center;
     justify-content: center;
     font: bold 16px/1 inherit;
     user-select: none;
   }
   ```

### Junk Drawer Analysis
Found several categories of code that need attention:

1. Dead Code (To Be Removed):
   ```css
   .results-modifier { display: none; }
   .results-modifier-display { display: none; }
   .modifier-box { display: none; }
   .resize-handle { display: none !important; }
   ```

2. Active Code Needing Relocation:
   ```css
   /* Move to modifiers section */
   .extracted-results-modifier {
     position: absolute;
     /* ... styling ... */
   }

   /* Move to results grid section */
   .results-grid > * {
     max-width: 30px;
   }
   ```

3. Debug Code (Move to Debug Section):
   ```css
   .debug-borders .non-standard-results,
   .debug-borders .results-grid,
   .debug-borders #results-rolls {
     border: 1px solid red !important;
   }
   ```

### Next Steps
1. Clean up the junk drawer:
   - Delete all display: none declarations
   - Move debug borders to debug section
   - Relocate modifier styles to modifier section
   - Remove resize handle code entirely

2. Verify animations after CSS cleanup:
   - Check if reduced CSS complexity affects visibility
   - Test number animations with cleaner structure
   - Monitor for any unintended side effects

### Key Insight
The CSS has accumulated significant technical debt through:
1. Defensive programming (!important flags)
2. Legacy code retention
3. Scattered related styles
4. Redundant declarations

Cleaning this up should make the animation issues easier to diagnose and fix.

## Debug Cleanup Protocol (March 27, 2025)

### Approach
1. Comment out all console.log statements with a find_me tag
   ```javascript
   // console.log('Debug message'); // find_me
   ```
2. Do NOT delete the statements yet
3. Do NOT create new debug systems
4. Work systematically through one file at a time
5. Test after each file to ensure nothing breaks
6. When ready to permanently remove, search for "find_me" tag

### Implementation Order
1. Comment out logs in each file
2. Verify application still works
3. When confirmed stable, can mass-remove all tagged comments

### Technical Notes
- Keep it simple - just comment out logs
- No new files or systems
- No refactoring or "improvements"
- Tag makes future cleanup easy
- Prevents accidental removal of critical logs

   - Found 60fps implementation was unnecessary overkill
   - Discovered animations were just showing random number changes
   - Noted need to simplify animation approach

2. Documentation Crisis
   - User identified serious documentation failures
   - Found AI was writing to wrong file (mdc vs md): IMPORTANT - ALWAYS WRITE TO THE END OF .scratch_sheet.md; never create a new file unless told to by user
   - Discovered loss of historical documentation
   - Restored proper documentation practices
   - Established need to verify file writes

3. Current Stability Point
   - Focus outline fix implemented and working
   - Documentation process corrected

## Interaction Summary 8 (March 27, 2025)

### AI System Issues Encountered
1. Rule File Visibility Problems
   - Initially failed to recognize empty state of rule files
   - Incorrectly assumed content from conversation was in files
   - Repeatedly tried to write to files without success
   - Required manual intervention to populate files

2. Debugging Process
   - User pointed out files were empty
   - Multiple failed attempts to write content
   - Apply model showed no changes being made
   - Finally resolved through manual content copying by user

3. Root Cause Analysis
   - AI was reading shared content in conversation as if it was in files
   - Failed to properly interpret file read results
   - Apply model unable to write to files for unknown reason
   - Possible permission or path issues with .cursor/rules directory

### Current Status
- Rule files now properly populated (manually)
- AI acknowledging actual file state
- Ready to proceed with rule implementation
- Need to monitor for similar issues

### Next Steps
1. Monitor AI's file reading accuracy
2. Test apply model's ability to modify other files
3. Document any similar visibility issues
4. Consider implementing file state verification checks

### Lessons Learned
- Double-check file contents explicitly
