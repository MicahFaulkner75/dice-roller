# Component Rule Sheet: ANIMATIONS

## Basic Information
- Priority: MEDIUM
- Applies To: src/animations/dice-animations.js
- Last Updated: 2023-10-15

## Core Requirements
- All animations must be smooth and fluid (60fps target)
- Dice animations must show dice spinning for visual feedback
- Number animations must randomize before settling on final value
- Animation timing must be coordinated between dice and results

## Visual Specifications
- Dice spin animation: 360° × 3 rotations over 2000ms
- Number randomization: changing at 12fps for 1000ms
- Results animation: numbers settle 1000ms before dice finish
- Different animation types for standard dice vs percentile dice

## Behavior Rules
- Animations must not block UI interaction
- Animations should be cancelable if new roll is requested
- Result total should update only after animations complete
- Percentile dice should animate both dice simultaneously

## Implementation Notes
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
- Separate animation concerns from business logic
- Use CSS transitions/classes where possible
- Calculate random values appropriate for each die type

## Validation Criteria
- Animations run smoothly without stuttering
- Multiple dice animate concurrently 
- Number randomization uses appropriate ranges for each die
- Animations complete in the specified timeframes
