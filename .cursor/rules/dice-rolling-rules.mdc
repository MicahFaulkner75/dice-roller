# Component Rule Sheet: DICE_ROLLING

## Basic Information
- Priority: HIGH
- Applies To: core-functions.js, dice-logic.js, animations/dice-animations.js
- Last Updated: 2023-10-15

## Core Requirements
- Standard dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20) must be implemented as single dice
- Percentile dice (d00/d100) must display two d10 dice (tens and ones)
- All dice results must be animated before revealing final value
- Order of dice must be preserved in results display

## Visual Specifications
- Standard dice animate with a single spinning motion (360° × 3)
- Percentile dice show two colored d10 dice spinning simultaneously
- Animation duration: 2000ms for dice spin, 1000ms for number randomization
- Results appear in output area with appropriate color coding by die type

## Behavior Rules
- Clicking a die button adds that die to pool without rolling (unless autoRoll=true)
- Double-clicking d10 activates percentile mode
- Long-pressing d10 also activates percentile mode
- Entering "d00" or "d100" in notation creates percentile roll
- Non-standard dice (e.g., d30) display in format "dX=Y" in results

## Implementation Notes
- Use state API functions instead of direct state manipulation
- Separate animation logic from core rolling functionality
- Maintain dice order between input and output displays
- The "00"+"0" combination equals 100, not 0

## Validation Criteria
- All dice types can be added and rolled individually
- Percentile mode activates correctly via all three methods
- Mixed dice pools roll and display in correct order
- Non-standard dice format correctly in results area
